This is a pretty useless library that adds grade names for Category A and B in the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education.
# Category A gradings
- U: Unclassified
- 1: Unsatisfactory
- 2: Marginal
- 3: Average
- 4: Satisfactory
- 5: Good
- 5*: Outstanding
- 5**: Excellent

*(The names were taken from my school report card.
In fact, I could neither find the names from the official website of HKEAA nor the [WiKi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Diploma_of_Secondary_Education#Grading).)*
